        <!--Here I displayed an image which I learned the technique from W3schools. -->
        <p class="center">
            Create an HTML5 web page in your public_html directory that 
            introduces yourself and can be used as an index 
            to the future assignments in this course. 
            Your web page need not be fancy, but it should show that you have put 
            in effort to use the techniques and tags discussed in class so far.  
            Lay out the page so that it can be used as an index to all of the future 
            assignments you will do for this course.  You need to use at least some CSS 
            (in an external file), but again, your page need not be fancy at this point.  
            You can continue to improve it throughout the semester as you learn new 
            techniques. (Taken from Prof. Heines assignment 2 page)

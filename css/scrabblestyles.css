    This style sheet was based on my previous style sheet minus all of the styles 
    from previous assignments as the other one was getting too big and long.
    Also with such a big assignment I thought it was better to make a new sheet with
    the essential styles from the previous style sheet. This style sheet is mainly 
    for assignment 9 and the classes/IDs styles as well. 
  
  For Assignment 5 material scroll down below I marked where it began and ended.

This portion of the code was from a video I watched on youtube on creating a 
navigation bar. At first the video did not make much sense to me. But after
reading more at w3schools.com and searching the web on syntax and code that the
video creater did, everything made much more sense. There were a few parts where
I still did not understand completely like the 960px value and where the 
uploader got that value from. The video's URL is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN1iMaVfzfQ
I also conversed with Jason Downing on problems that I came across.

  Create your own web site that will be used as an index for future work. 
  Incorporate ideas, tags, and other materials taught in class into the web site.

  Also, while extending my stylesheet for assignment 3, I also learned a lot of new CSS commands.
  For instance I learned the background function that allowed me to change the opacity of the 
  background. I also learned to add a border to my texts and made the texts inside a box, and
  display:table to move certain texts properly. In Addition, I learned out how to display bullet
  points inside of the border or block that I created with the line-style-position command.
  All of these were learned from W3schools.com and their CSS tutorials. I also used stack overflow
  which I provided a link below to the specific post/thread I looked at.

/*Specific class for lists to further format the ul tag.
  Here I made the text white, had a display table to actually move the 
  whole bulleted list over to the center of the page. 
  Added a background and border and adjusted its dimensions to match the border above.
  I had a hard time getting the bullets to fit inside the border without disrupting the dimension
  of the border but this stack overflow post showed me about list-style-position.

/*
This portion of the code was from a video I watched on youtube on creating a 
navigation bar. At first the video did not make much sense to me. But after
reading more at w3schools.com and searching the web on syntax and code that the
video creater did, everything made much more sense. There were a few parts where
I still did not understand completely like the 960px value and where the 
uploader got that value from. The video's URL is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN1iMaVfzfQ
I also conversed with Jason Downing on problems that I came across.

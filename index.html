  Create your own web site that will be used as an index for future work. 
  Incorporate ideas, tags, and other materials taught in class into the web site.
  The two resources that I mainly used was from a video on youtube to make a 
  navigation bar and also w3schools.com for basic HTML and CSS.

            I also made a class for it to position it accordingly to my page. I explained 
            what I did to position it more in my .css file. Also the html validator button was

  Create your own web site that will be used as an index for future work. 
  Incorporate ideas, tags, and other materials taught in class into the web site.
  The two resources that I mainly used was from a video on youtube to make a 
  navigation bar and also w3schools.com for basic HTML and CSS. 
   
  I also changed my index.html and now made an About.html where I added a few 
  facts about myself. I also embedded a Youtube playlist that I created to share
  some of the music I enjoy.
